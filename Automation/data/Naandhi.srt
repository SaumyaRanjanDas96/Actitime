1
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:14,708
Across the entire country, since the beginning of 2015,
There are 1401 prisons.

2
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,916
3,66,781 prisoners are held in them.

3
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,875
Amongst them, 68% of them...

4
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:25,625
i.e. 2,54,000 are serving out their
sentences as under trail prisoners.

5
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:30,416
That means, these prisoners are serving time even
though the courts haven’t passed their verdict.

6
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,750
The court may pass the judgement for their
incarceration or even acquit them of charges.

7
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,916
It’s been three years since my son was sent to jail.

8
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,583
The police arrested him on the charge that
he killed someone in a drunken stupor.

9
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,000
But my son doesn’t drink at all.

10
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,833
Given that my son doesn’t drink,
how could my son have killed a person?

11
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,875
My son got a good job in Dubai, sir.

12
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,708
He was supposed to leave in ten days.

13
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,083
Police have arrested him under wrong charges.

14
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,708
He is right now in jail.

15
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:04,041
His entire life is ruined, sir.
He is ruined. We are ruined, sir.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,416
My uncle committed suicide
because of a petty squabble.

17
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:15,416
The police accused my parents
as the responsible party and put them in jail, sir.

18
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,500
I have a younger brother and younger sister, sir.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,625
I need to feed them and educate them, sir.

20
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,375
Given my desperate situation...

21
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,791
I turned into a call girl
when I was 15 years old.

22
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,750
Each of those people languishing in jails have a story.

23
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,875
And there is a lot of pain that
their families go through as well.

24
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,500
In September 2014, supreme court passed an order.

25
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,791
According to that, an undertrial criminal
who served more than half of the time...

26
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51,333
before he/she is convicted of the crime
by the courts, must be released.

27
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:57,958
Despite that order, none of the states have submitted any records
regarding the number of convicts released based on this order.

28
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,708
Sir...

29
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:05,375
If our country spent at least 10% of the attention it gave
to the economic affairs, to social welfare projects such as this...

30
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,250
these kinds of mistakes would not have happened.

31
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,000
Every five years, we have elections.

32
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,208
They promise a lot of things for free to the people.

33
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:15,666
But...

34
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,791
why is it that we must purchase justice?

35
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,375
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,708
I understand.

37
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,666
Thanks for bringing it to the government's notice.

38
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:28,250
I will thoroughly discuss this with our law department.

39
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,083
Thank you, sir.

40
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,250
Sir?

41
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:38,166
In this file, there are case details of the
accused undertrial prisoners from all 29 states.

42
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:43,666
Please create awareness amongst eligible prisoners and
even amongst people regarding this section 211, sir.

43
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:48,625
If everyone is as responsible as you,
our country will soon see good social growth.

44
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,208
If the citizen is responsible,
we can only expect 10% growth.

45
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,250
But if the politician is responsible,
we can see 90% growth.

46
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,000
It’s because they are the ones who create the laws
and they are also the ones who implement these laws.

47
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,208
I understand.

48
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,958
Thank you, Mr Raja Gopal.

49
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,583
In the next parliament session,
I will make sure that there is a discussion on this.

50
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,666
Thank you very much, sir.

51
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,958
See you, Mr Raja Gopal.

52
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,291
Get down!
Get down!

53
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,916
What are you looking at?

54
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:15,541
Get in. Move on.

55
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,041
What is your name?
-Jaggarla Mallesham.

56
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,500
What’s your crime?
-I committed theft and landed in prison.

57
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,708
Next?

58
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,541
Come here.

59
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,583
What’s your name?

60
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,583
Surya Prakash.

61
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,708
What’s your full name?

62
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,250
Bandi Surya Prakash.

63
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,250
Bandi Surya Prakash.

64
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,416
What crime did you commit that landed you in prison?

65
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,125
He is remanded for Fourteen days, sir.

66
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,666
Alright.
Sign here.

67
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,291
Who’s next?
-Come here.

68
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,416
Stand here.

69
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:56,916
What’s your name?

70
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,458
Rama Rao, sir.

71
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,083
Remove your shirt.

72
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,000
Where do you stay?
-Kukatpally, sir. [Background]

73
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,833
Turn around. Turn.

74
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:06,666
I committed murder.

75
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,291
Oh! Murder case..?

76
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,708
Remove your pants.

77
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,083
Sign here.
-Okay Sir.

78
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,291
Sign here... and get in.

79
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,791
I asked you to remove your pants.
Why do you keep looking about?

80
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,541
Remove them.

81
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,750
Remove your underwear.

82
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,291
Remove. I asked you to remove your underwear.

83
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,625
Place both your hands above
your heads and squat down.

84
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:08,500
'After Five years'

85
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,166
Get down! Get down!

86
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,416
Hurry! Get down!

87
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,041
Get down! Get down, man!

88
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,875
Uncle, thank you so much.

89
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,625
You handcuffed me and got me here.
Even though I am here on a petty case.

90
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,416
What a great job!

91
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,208
Listen, my phone is in this pocket.

92
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,750
Take it out and snap a picture of me.
-Why do you want a picture of you taken?

93
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,125
Why, you ask?

94
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:45,500
'The social media languishing among the shackles.'

95
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,875
This is going to be my next YouTube video.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,041
It’s going to be telecast on RTV.
Watch it

97
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,375
Uncle, namaste.

98
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:51,958
Namaste.

99
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,625
You are back again?

100
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,625
What did you post this time?

101
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,541
This time...

102
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,083
I posted something called,
“Pooja Preeth Agarwal says that likes to fall asleep while on top”.

103
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:01,833
Goodness!

104
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,583
How could you have put up a scandalous
post like that about a top heroine?

105
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,125
Why are you reacting like her manager did?

106
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,750
Apparently, she bought a new mattress from the market
and only when she sleeps on top of it, she feels good.

107
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,041
She posted it on Twitter
and I posted it on YouTube.

108
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,166
Just cause of that, they started making such a lot of fuss
and sent me here for seven days.

109
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,875
You are such a twisted guy.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,416
Despite being sent here numerous times,
I don’t understand how this would make a difference, brother.

111
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:27,666
Everything okay?

112
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,750
Okay. Go ahead.

113
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,125
What is it? Are you new here?

114
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,833
They don’t provide uniform to people
who are serving time for petty cases.

115
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,583
He’s been given a sentence of two years!

116
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,083
Gosh! Where do these people come from?!

117
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,916
Go that side and hurry.

118
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,083
Why is he getting angry?
Did he get his blood pressure checked?

119
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,875
For now, I will adjust.
But the next time around, I want a better room.

120
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,750
Well, did you subscribe to RTV’s YouTube channel?

121
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
I will get to it. Get inside now.

122
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,375
You must also press the bell icon.
That is when you would get fresh updates.

123
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,416
Hey, bro.

124
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,625
Hi.

125
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,083
I am Radha Prakash.

126
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,625
I am the Managing Director of Telugu Youtube channel RTV
with 1.34 million subscribers.

127
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:58,541
Bro?

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Hey, bro?

129
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,666
I feel like a DJ at a meditation center.

130
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,416
He isn’t very talkative and
I can’t stop talking at all.

131
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,125
Oh, my Pooja Preet Agarwal!

132
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,208
I wonder how I should spend
my seven days of sentence here.

133
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,041
Hey, bro.

134
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:28,875
You are drying your clothes?

135
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,250
Brother? Brother…

136
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,750
What’s with all this noise?!

137
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,916
Too much sound pollution.

138
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,166
As a DJ, I am used to all this noise.
But people here make a lot more noise.

139
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,875
Goodness!

140
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,958
I keep coming here
for the past five years, brother.

141
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,333
The kitchen here has really
turned into a fish market, brother.

142
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,833
My father and my mother.

143
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,541
They fed me for the past 25 years.

144
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,666
By the time it was my turn to feed them...

145
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,125
they passed away.

146
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,958
They carried me on their shoulders.

147
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:47,250
I never imagined that I would carry the weight
of their death this soon in my life.

148
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,000
That is why, every time I eat,

149
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,000
I set aside two fistfuls of rice…

150
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,708
…as a way of reminding myself
that they are with me.

151
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,416
That’s all.

152
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:10,583
In this world, if there ever is unconditional love,
it is forever the love we get from our parents.

153
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,583
I guarantee it.

154
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:16,625
Brother?

155
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,375
Brother?

156
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,541
Brother?

157
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:20,875
Why did you throw it away?

158
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,416
Brother, did I say something wrong?

159
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:24,958
Brother?

160
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,125
Brother? Please speak to me.
Say something.

161
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,291
Rama, is our son asleep?
-Yes, husband.

162
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,916
You got everything on the list.
Why didn’t you get your usual bottle of liquor?

163
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,875
From now on, I quit smoking and drinking.

164
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,166
We enrolled our son in the convent.

165
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,875
Use the spare money to see to his needs.

166
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,375
That’s true.

167
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,666
Well, please stop buying me these
fairness creams and powders.

168
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,541
Son, have this one mouthful and
carry on riding your bicycle.

169
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,875
No, mother. I don’t want it.

170
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,333
Husband, why don’t you tell him?

171
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,916
Son, listen to your mother. Have some and go.

172
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:26,916
I don’t want it.

173
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:27,750
Come, dear.

174
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,625
Ride carefully.

175
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,708
Yes, father.

176
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,000
Careful!
You will fall down!

177
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,541
Careful!
Careful, son!

178
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,416
Son!

179
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,875
Brother, what happened?
Here, have some water.

180
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,583
Brother, why do you stay silent?

181
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:14,416
God gave us water so that
whenever there is fire, we can douse it.

182
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,583
If that same fire burns in our hearts...

183
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,041
God gave us tears to douse it.

184
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,416
If you’ve been stopping yourself from
crying for the past five years...

185
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,708
Something must have happened.

186
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:31,916
What happened, brother?

187
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,375
Are your parents…

188
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,666
Cousin? Shall we go to the liquor store?

189
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,750
Are you really giving me a party
with your first salary?

190
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,333
Not for you; for my father.

191
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,750
For your father? Alright, let’s go.

192
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:39,833
Mother?

193
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,791
I am here only.

194
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,750
Mother, here.

195
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,208
This is my first salary.

196
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,291
Where is father?

197
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,958
He is showering.

198
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,083
Mother, could you please
make an omelet immediately?

199
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:04,500
Mother...

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
how much longer?

201
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,333
I am almost done.

202
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,833
Here. Give it to me.
Let me do it.

203
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,708
Give it to me.

204
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,791
What is this, son?

205
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,375
This is for you, father.

206
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,083
But, I quit this a long time ago.

207
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,916
I know you quit because of me,
when I was young.

208
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,333
That is why I got it for you.

209
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,458
Come, father.

210
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,375
Come, father.
Come and sit down.

211
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:37,791
Here, drink it.

212
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:39,833
Drink.

213
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,666
What’s up with him?
He arranged for all this.

214
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,666
Why go through all this trouble, son?
-Drink it, father.

215
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,041
Your son is earning now...

216
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,000

Of course, you fell for her.

257
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,583
Where did she go?

258
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,333
Brother?

259
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:37,458
Brother?

260
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,208
Step aside a little.

261
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:42,958
Brother?

262
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,166
What’s up? Why are you looking at me that way?

263
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,500
I just asked you to move a little.

264
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,291
She called me ‘brother’!

265
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,458
She called me her brother; not you.

266
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,458
Really?

267
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,666
If you want something to happen between the two of you,
you must assume that’s the case.

268
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,083
Let’s go.

269
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,291
Let’s go.

270
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,000
Look at how crowded it is.

271
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,875
There is a new app called ‘Book my show’.

272
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,416
I told you that I would book through the app.

273
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,166
But you said that we could find
the tickets at the theatre.

274
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,416
What do we do now?

275
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,375
Brother?

276
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:32,958
Brother?

277
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,041
I am talking to you.

278
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,250
Yes, brother.

279
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,541
Brother, are you fine?

280
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,166
Didn’t you recognize me?

281
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,833
The other day, you saw me in the temple?

282
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:49,583
Brother?

283
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,375
The ladies line is quite long.

284
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,208
Could you please get us four tickets, please?

285
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,041
Please, brother.
Please, don’t mind.

286
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,541
Here.

287
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,291
Thank you, brother.

288
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,166
I will meet you during the intermission
and treat you to a cold drink.

289
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,083
Intermission...

290
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,000
Why would you treat us only during the intermission?

291
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why can’t you treat us now?

292
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,916
You want to marry her
And she wants to friendzone you.

293
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:22,750
Let’s go.

294
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,291
The show is about to start.
Let’s go.

295
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,333
You are on a date with a potential bride in a coffee shop?

296
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,125
What about that girl you met at the temple?

297
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,208
My father suggested it.

298
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,458
I couldn’t say no to him. So, I came here.

299
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,541
Okay.

300
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,458
You go ahead. I will park the bike and head there.

301
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,125
Okay, cousin.

302
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,625
Brother?

303
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:53,583
Brother?

304
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:54,750
What are you doing here?

305
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,875
What are you looking at?

306
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,625
Come, brother.
Come and take a seat.

307
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:04,583
Sit.

308
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:06,541
Woah…

309
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,958
formal pants, a shirt
and you’ve even tucked your shirt in.

310
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,791
What’s the matter, brother?

311
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,583
You cleaned up pretty nice.

312
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:18,333
I don’t know about you but
I came here to meet a potential groom.

313
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,416
Meenakshi?

314
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,583
Are you the one who is supposed to meet me?

315
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,416
This is so exciting.

316
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,666
Surya?

317
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:32,791
Surya?

318
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,791
One minute.

319
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,208
My father showed me a photograph of you
on the morning of the day of full moon.

320
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,666
Everyone liked you.

321
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,666
That very evening, you followed me
and tried to flirt with me.

322
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:52,500
I was very thrilled to find out that the one
I was going to marry was in fact trying to flirt with me.

323
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,208
Up until we met formally like this,
I wanted to tease you a bit.

324
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,791
If our kids ask us about how we ended up
getting married to each other...

325
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:04,125
we must have a story to tell, right?

326
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,458
If that was the case, why did you keep
calling him ‘brother’ every time you met?

327
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:13,791
You always have such bad timing.

328
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:15,625
I just did that to tease him a bit.

329
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,916
Just’ cause I did that,
it does not make us siblings. Am I right, brother?

330
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Just because you said that,
it doesn’t make you guys related.

331
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,625
Most certainly not.

332
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,750
I guarantee it.

333
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,583
I am, her brother.

334
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:28,916

362
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,416
In Nallagandla the outskirts of the city...

363
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:27,041
the prominent lawyer and the leader of Citizen’s Rights Union,
Raja Gopal was found murdered.

364
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,875
As you can see, the Chandanagar police have been conducting
an investigation in the area where the murder took place.

365
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,375
I called the C.I Sir.
He is on his way to the crime scene.

366
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:34,333
Okay, sir.

367
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:39,250
This murder is said to have taken place at 10 o’clock in the night
in Nalagandla area, which is in the jurisdiction of Chanda Nagar Police.

368
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:39,791
Take the photo.

369
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,500
Check if there are any
fingerprints on the body.

370
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:45,750
Sir, why do you think Mr. Raja Gopal
came to a place such as this, alone?

371
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,791
Sir, is this murder the work of land mafia?

372
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,083
Do you think someone was hired to kill him?

373
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:51,750
Would you say that this murder is
a result of police negligence?

374
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,458
Sir, do you suspect anyone of this murder?

375
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,458
Is he operating alone or is there
someone else behind this murder?

376
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,916
Sir... sir... sir...

377
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,291
Who committed this crime?
-Wait! Wait! Wait!

378
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,791
Wait...
-Sir? Sir?

379
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,291
Please let me do my work.

380
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:11,500
Sir...

381
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,791
Who gave us the information?

382
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,083
Our patrolling police.

383
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,125
Did you find any clues?
-Not yet, sir.

384
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,500
Did you inform his family members?

385
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,208
Yes, sir. We did.

386
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,875
Take care of the post mortem formalities, Reddy.

387
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:30,375
Okay, sir.

388
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,041
Bhaskar!

389
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:33,458
Sir.

390
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,041
Take the body and bring it to Gandhi Hospital.

391
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:35,500
Okay, sir.

392
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,000
Sir, is it an accident or a murder?

393
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,250
It is definitely a murder.

394
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,541
Sir, who committed this crime?

395
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,666
How many people do you suspect
with regards this murder?

396
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,000
Sir, is this a political murder?

397
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,000
Sir, who committed this murder?
-Did you find any clues?

398
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,833
Please, wait.

399
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:48,541
At this moment, I know just as much as you do.

400
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,375
Who killed him, why was he killed
and what was the motive…

401
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,583
all these need to be investigated.

402
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,166
So, please let me do my work.

403
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,250
Who could have benefited from
the death of the victim, Raja Gopal?

404
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:00,708
Did someone commit the crime for personal reasons or
were there other reasons involved?

405
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,208
Let’s find out about this soon
from the investigation.

406
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:12,208
A short while ago, Mr Raja Gopal’s body was shifted
from Gandhi Hospital to his home in KPHB Colony.

407
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:17,833
A lot of people including people’s representatives and fans of
Mr. Raja Gopal have come to pay respects to him.

408
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,500
The home minister Mr. Nagendra has
come to pay his respects to the departed.

409
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,083
Good morning, sir.

410
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,500
Hey! Move! Move!

411
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:34,083
He was a very good person
who worked selflessly for the benefit of people.

412
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,625
He brought many issues to my attention.

413
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:41,833
On behalf of the government, I offer my heartfelt
condolences to Mr. Raja Gopal’s family.

414
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,125
Who is conducting this investigation?

415
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,625
Sir, I am conducting the investigation.

416
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,416
Speed up the investigation.

417
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:50,208
Present the criminals to the media.

418
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,291
Definitely, sir.

419
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:56,083
It looks like the Home Minister, Mr Nagendra,
has taken personal interest in this investigation.

420
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,166
The case was handed over to Circle Inspector Kishore,
who was transferred to Chanda Nagar a few days ago.

421
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:03,500
Mr Kishore holds the reputation of solving
cases within 24 hours of their occurrence.

422
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,750
Let’s see how soon it takes him to solve this case.

423
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:12,791
Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

424
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,166
Good morning, sir.
-Reddy?

425
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:17,666
Sir.

426
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,250
Good morning, sir.
-Did you get Mr. Raja Gopal’s phone records?

427
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,500
Yes, sir. I got it with me.

428
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:20,958
Here it is.

429
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,833
What are these last two calls?

430
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:28,958
This person is out of station.

431
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,000
He said that he would come by tomorrow.
I called the other one, sir.

432
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,083
Before he died, he called this landline six times.

433
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,958
That number belongs to
Mark Diagnostic Centre, sir.

434
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:38,875
We enquired there.

435
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,375
Apparently, the victim underwent tests
there at the center on that day.

436
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,583
Collect the CCTV footage there.

437
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,333
Okay, sir.

438
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:52,041
Let’s trace his movements and meetings for the week
before his death and find all the information.

439
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,458
And, I want it as soon as possible.

440
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,000
Okay, sir.

441
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,333
Greetings.

442
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:08,083
I am sorry to be disturbing you
at a time such as this.

443
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:17,625
Did you notice him being stressed or
receiving any sort of threatening calls recently?

444
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,500
Nothing of that sort, sir.

445
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,625
Do you suspect anyone?

446
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,333
He doesn’t have any enemies, sir.

447
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:33,791
Did you see anyone suspicious lurking about your house?

448
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,208
No, sir.

449
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,541
Does your father have a habit of writing a diary?

450
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:41,666
No, sir.

451
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:45,125
Okay, Madam.

452
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:49,916
If you remember anyone suspicious,
please call me immediately.

453
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:51,958
I shall take my leave.

454
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:53,208
Thank you.

455
00:33:57,416 --> 00:34:02,833
In protest to the murdering of Mr Raja Gopal, Human Rights groups
and people from both states, have conducted condolence meeting.

456
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,541
In certain places, rallies with lighted
candles were conducted as well.

457
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,791
Here are the ten lakhs you asked for.

458
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,250
Thank you for coming through as soon
as I asked for the amount, uncle.

459
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,375
The loan’s been approved.

460
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,041
As soon as I get the amount, I will return it to you.

461
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,250
You are a very good person.

462
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,166
It’s for this very reason that I gave you the money
without getting any sort of surety note from you.

463
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,625
Anyways, where are you purchasing the flat?

464
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,083
It’s in Aliens space station, Uncle.

465
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:29,375
Give the amount.

466
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,083
You give it.

467
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:32,750
Here.

468
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,000
Thank you, sir.

469
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:38,666
Thank you, sir.

470
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:39,750
Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

471
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,208
I will be the one to break the news that
we’ve purchased the flat to your parents.

472
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,291
Please hold on.
Let’s surprise them.

473
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,666
Tell your parents to come
to our place in the evening.

474
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:48,583
That’s all very well.

475
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,750
You are busy surprising one another.
What about me, then?

476
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:52,916
I am going to pay for your bill
at the bar for this weekend.

477
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,041
If that’s the case, alright then.

478
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,708
Even though it’s been three days since
the death of the social activist Mr Raja Gopal,

479
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:03,583
The government is unconcerned
about who killed him and why.

480
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,291
What is the department of police up to and
what is the government up to?

481
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,541
If this is going to be the way this state government
conducts the investigation..

482
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:12,416
we will demand that the Central government take up
the issue and order CBI to investigate this case.

483
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:42,083
Sir?

484
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,708
You hold the record of solving a case within 24 hours.

485
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,666
What’s the delay with regards this case?

486
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,083
The Investigation is going on... sir.

487
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:47,375
The opposition is demanding a CBI enquiry.

488
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,083
Did you get the CCTV footage ready?

489
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:49,458
Yes, sir.

490
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,083
Well, let’s show it to the officer.

491
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:51,625
He is speaking to the commissioner.

492
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,625
Please hurry and finish this investigation.

493
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,208
Sir…

494
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:27,833
Meenakshi...

495
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:29,625
Did you call your parents
and inform them?

496
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:30,541
I did.

497
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,291
They asked me what is the sudden programme was.

498
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,833
I told them to hurry and would inform
them when they got there.

499
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,791
Sir? What happened, sir?

500
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,875
What happened, sir?

501
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:44,500
Get off the bike!

502
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,500
Sir? Sir?

503
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,041
Get off!

504
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,041
Get off!

505
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,041
Sir, what happened?

506
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:48,708
Where are you taking me?

507
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,500
Move to station.

508
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,333
Hey!

509
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,291
Let’s go.

510
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,666
What happened, sir?
Get in the vehicle.

511
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,541
Take his bike and bag to the police station.
-Ok Sir.

512
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,875
Bhaskar…
-First you get in.

513
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,416
…take his bike and bag.

514
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,666
Sir? Why are you arresting him?

515
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:02,833
Hey, you...?

516
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,916
Sir! Please tell me. Please.

517
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:06,666
Drive.

518
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:07,458
Sir!

519
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:22,583
Sir, what do you mean I murdered Mr Raja Gopal?

520
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,416
Why did you kill him?

521
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:29,500
Sir, I am a software employee.

522
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,750
I think you must be mistaken.

523
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:36,500
I only heard about the man
but I never met him.

524
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:37,458
Is that so?

525
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,041
Reddy…

526
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:40,500
Sir!

527
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,500
See this...

528
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:47,000
On the day of the murder, at 10:30 in the morning...

529
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:50,916
you trailed Mr Raja Gopal
at the diagnostic center for the first time.

530
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:55,875
The second time was at the traffic signal.

531
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:04,333
The third time was at 10:30 in the night,
where you followed him to Avasa Hospital.

532
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:12,583
If you didn’t have any motive,
why would you have been caught trailing him thrice?

533
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,041
Sir, what do you mean I trailed and scouted him?

534
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,750
I went to that diagnostic centre
to get my mother’s reports.

535
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,583
Bandi Rama’s reports, please.

536
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,375
It would take half an hour.
Could you wait?

537
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,333
Sure.
-Okay.

538
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,333
That was the first time I saw Mr. Raja Gopal.

539
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,875
I went to the hospital to
show them the reports.

540
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,041
I didn’t know that Mr. Raja Gopal
was at the hospital during that time.

541
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:45,416
What you saw at the signal was a coincidence, sir.

542
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,625
This was very well planned…

543
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,458
very well planned.

544
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,125
Tell me something...

545
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:59,291
Did you take the money to murder him
or was it your father?

546
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:01,333
Sir! Don’t bad mouth my father!

547
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:09,166
Who was she on the bike?

548
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,625
Is she your friend?

549
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,250
or your lover?

550
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,916
Sir! Please show some manners!

551
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,958
Why would I show manners to a murderer?

552
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,541
I don’t think he will be
persuaded by our words, Reddy.

553
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:29,375
Sir...

554
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,125
He needs to be convinced to confess.

555
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,166
Go and convince him.

556
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,541
Get up! Go! Move!

557
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,333
Sir... Sir...

558
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,083
Move.... Come on move...
-Sir, please let me explain...

559
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,916
Sir! Sir! Please…
Sir, please this is a misunderstanding.

560
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,333
Tell me!
Who is behind this?

561
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:45,958
Who is behind this?

562
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:46,958
Why did you murder him?

563
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:47,875
Tell me.

564
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,375
Who gave you the contract to kill him?

565
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,208
Speak out.

566
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,833
Sir, this is the receipt of ten lakhs
that was paid for his flat.

567
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,458
Seize everything.

568
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,000
Ok, sir.

569
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,541
We need to submit this in the court.
-Okay, sir.

570
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,666
Sami.
Sir?

571
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,000
Type out the FIR.
-Yes, sir.

572
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:01,250
Admit it!

573
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,791
Why did you kill him? Spill.

574
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:04,833
What’s that noise?

575
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:05,750
Speak out.

576
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:07,875
Sami.
-Sir.

577
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,625
Tell Mr. Reddy.
-Okay Sir.

578
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,208
Despite the number of times I tell him, he still does this.

579
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,083
Tell him to make sure that there is no sound.

580
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,708
C.I Kishore, who takes up challenging cases
has managed to nab the culprit within 3 days.

581
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,875
The police are now investigating
if the suspect has any criminal background.

582
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,500
We find that the Circle Inspector Kishore
is interrogating the accused.

583
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,916
Let’s go and find out from Surya Prakash’s parents.

584
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,041
Why did your son commit the murder?

585
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,916
Are there any issues between both the families?

586
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,500
Sir, did your son commit this murder on his own accord
or is there anyone else besides him?

587
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,541
Did you know that your son
would commit such the murder?

588
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:38,791
Lady….young man….

589
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:41,166
My son is in no way related to this murder.

590
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,666
The police are mistaken and
have arrested our son.

591
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:46,750
If you want, you can enquire about him
in our colony or at his office.

592
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,125
They would attest to his character.

593
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,083
Let’s get inside immediately.

594
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,458
Please Sir... Please...

595
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,083
Sir, please answer this question.

596
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:52,958
Stop! Stop!

597
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,666
Our C.I has commanded
that no one be allowed inside.

598
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,083
He will speak to you after he comes here.

599
00:40:56,166 --> 00:40:56,916
You keep quiet.

600
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:57,791
What is it?

601
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:58,500
Sir... sir...

602
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,250
My son is a very good person.

603
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
He is in no way related to this murder.

604
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,833
Since there is evidence, we have arrested him.

605
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:05,083
It was a misunderstanding, sir.

606
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,583
Could you please allow us to meet
the chief inspector, sir?

607
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,583
Please, sir. I beg you.

608
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:09,125
The FIR has already been filed.

609
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,916
There is no use meeting with the C.I now.

610
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:12,583
Go away. Go and find yourselves a good lawyer.

611
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,250
We are going to surrender him to the court tomorrow.

612
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,750
Sir, I will just take a look at
my son once before we leave.

613
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,958
The FIR has already been filed.

614
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:18,833
I keep telling you this.

615
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,083
Please, sir.

616
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:23,000
Uncle, let’s go and meet a reputed lawyer.

617
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,333
They will help free our Surya.

618
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:27,083
I am worried how he is inside.

619
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,291
Please, uncle. Come away.

620
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,583
Please, let me look at him once.

621
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,833
Let’s go, aunt. Let’s go.

622
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:33,625
Husband, please tell them.

623
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,125
Proceed.

624
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:44,708
My lord...

625
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:48,041
in the case of the murder of the
human right’s activist Mr. Raja Gopal...

626
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:53,083
the police have presented Bandi Surya Praksash, the
son of Bandi Satya Narayana before the court.

627
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,125
Our son doesn’t know anything about this, madam.

628
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,125
He is an innocent.

629
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,791
They have intentionally accused him.

630
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,875
He is innocent, madam.
He is innocent.

631
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:00,500
Silence!

632
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,708
Silence! Silence!

633
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,250
Who is the defense lawyer?

634
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:05,958
My lord...

635
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,500
It’s because the accused murdered
Mr. Raja Gopal, who himself is a lawyer...

636
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:13,000
the Bar Association has decided not to take up his case.

637
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:18,708
Do you have any evidence that he committed this murder?

638
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:19,500
Yes, ma’am.

639
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:25,083
There is CCTV footage which shows that the accused followed
the victim thrice on the day of the murder.

640
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:25,833
Show it.

641
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:46,416
Ma'am...

642
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,541
He has scouted and trailed the victim
and committed the murder at 10:00 in the night, madam.

643
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:57,333
On the day of the murder, that very morning,
he paid Rs.10 lakhs as advance for a flat, madam.

644
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:02,500
What is this?
-He borrowed the money.

645
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,125
Where did he receive that ten lakhs from?

646
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,291
Was that part of the contract to kill?

647
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:14,083
What’s the relationship between the murder and that money?

648
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,083
The police need to investigate this
and charge an additional FIR.

649
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:20,583
We request the court to give him
into our custody for investigation.

650
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,916
Madam, I borrowed that 10 lakhs.

651
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,791
I took it from Mr. Parameshwar who lives in our colony.

652
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,416
If needed, you can call him here
and ask him about it.

653
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,458
You must answer only when you are asked a question.

654
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:33,458
Madam, the police are deliberately trying to frame me.

655
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,125
Silence!

656
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,833
I don’t even know who Mr.Raja Gopal is, madam.

657
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,583
Please, madam. I did not commit that murder.

658
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:38,708
Silence! Silence!

659
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:46,333
You can present your arguments
to the court through a defense lawyer.

660
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:53,375
The court orders that a lawyer be
appointed for him from the Legal Aid Services.

661
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:55,833
Three days granted for custody.

662
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,666
Madam! Please save me from the police...
-Let’s go.

663
00:43:58,666 --> 00:44:01,500
CI Kishore intentionally trying
to frame me in this case, madam.

664
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,583
Madam, Please save me....
Madam please.

665
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,416
Dad...

666
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,791
Is there anyone else beside him
who is involved in the murder?

667
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,208
Sir? Sir?
-Sir, one second.

668
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:10,833
Father...

669
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:11,666
Sir? Sir?

670
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,458
How many days is he to remain in custody?

671
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,166
Sir?

672
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:16,166
Oh my! Surya!

673
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,166
Father...

674
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,416
Please let my son go.

675
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,333
Please save me, Dad.

676
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,125
Surya?
Surya?

677
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,333
I didn't commit this murder.

678
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,666
Stop. Stop the vehicle, please.

679
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:23,250
Sir? Sir?

680
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:24,333
Surya?
-Surya?

681
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,291
Surya?

682
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:27,750
Cousin!

683
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,208
Surya?
-Surya?

684
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,958
Did your Son Suryaprakash commit this murder?

685
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,208
Sir, my son is unblemished.

686
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,583
You are all from media.

687
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,541
If you wish it, you can do anything.

688
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,958
My son did not commit this murder.
Please help prove that he is innocent.

689
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,625
I beg you.
-Sir... sir... sir...

690
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,458
We are scared of what they
would do to him when he’s in their custody.

691
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,458
Please save him.

692
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,333
Please save him.

693
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:54,250
Please save him.

694
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,041
Please save him.

695
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,958
You committed the murder, right?
Confess!

696
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:03,833
Admit it!

697
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,208
Admit to the crime!

698
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,166
Admit it!

699
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,166
Admit!

700
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:17,708
Admit!

701
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:21,750
Admit!

702
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,458
Admit!

703
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,666
I made a lot of people confess their crimes.

704
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,833
I am going to make sure
he confesses to this crime.

705
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,375
I will...

706
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:58,791
Uncle?

707
00:45:59,083 --> 00:45:59,666
Uncle?

708
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:01,416
Why are you closing your windows?

709
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:02,166
Uncle?

710
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:03,125
Uncle?

711
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,166
Uncle?

712
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,041
Uncle?

713
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:09,208
Open the door, uncle!

714
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:11,041
Please listen to understand what I say.

715
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,416
Why did you close the door?!

716
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,041
Uncle? Uncle, what happened?

717
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,833
Brother, what happened?
-Tell me what happened, uncle?

718
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,916
Please listen to me, brother.
-Uncle? Uncle?

719
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:20,833
Please Brother-in-law!

720
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:26,875
What happened, uncle?

721
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:28,625
Aunt, at least you tell me.
What happened?

722
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,250
Please, listen to me, Sathyam.

723
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,500
Uncle! Uncle!

724
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:32,791
What are you doing?!
-Uncle!

725
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,541
Please, uncle. I beg you. Please.

726
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,708
Please listen to us, sister-in-law.

727
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:36,541
Brother….

728
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:38,625
Brother-in-law…. what are you doing?

729
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:39,958
Don’t do it! Brother!

730
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:40,916
Please, listen to us!

731
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:41,750
Please, wait.

732
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,000
My son is innocent.

733
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:51,750
That C.I took him into custody for three days
because he’s trying to frame my son for the murder.

734
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,000
No one is looking for the truth here.

735
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,666
Until the police let my son go...

736
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:03,958
my wife and I are going to sit here
in the house and fast until death.

737
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:07,500
If anyone tries to enter the house forcefully…

738
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:11,333
We will immolate ourselves.

739
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:13,291
Uncle, please.
I beg you. Don’t do this.

740
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,291
Please listen to us.

741
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,583
Only when my son returns home...

742
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,916
will those doors reopen.

743
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:20,666
If not…

744
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,208
Please, uncle. Open the doors.

745
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:27,791
If anything happens to you,
imagine what he would go through.

746
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:28,833
Please open the door, Satyam.

747
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,750
We are all here with you.

748
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,583
Rama…listen to us.

749
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,833
Nothing is going to happen to your son.

750
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:36,125
My son should get out of there as an innocent.

751
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:40,000
That C.I should be
taken to the court of law as a culprit.

752
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,666
This…This must happen.

753
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,833
This must happen.

754
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,166
My son...

755
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,541
My son should get out.

756
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,500
My son...

757
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,416
My son should get out.

758
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,125
Did he eat anything?

759
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:10,875
No, sir.

760
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:12,375
Get him to eat.

761
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:14,291
If he doesn’t eat, he looks like he is going to die.

762
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,041
He must admit to the charges, isn’t it?

763
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:18,291
Wake him up.

764
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,916
Sign this statement which says
that you committed the murder.

765
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,208
Find the one who committed this murder...

766
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,125
and get him to sign it.

767
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:03,208
Reddy!

768
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,750
How many times…how many?!

769
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:30,125
Admit to it!

770
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,250
Admit to it!

771
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,750
Won’t you listen?

772
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,583
Surya Prakash's parents have been
on a hunger strike since last night.

773
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,333
In support of this move, the people of colony along with
Mr. Surya Prakash’s friends are seen participating in this hunger strike.

774
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:57,083
All the people participating in the hunger strike believe
Mr. Surya Prakash to be innocent and say that he is innocent.

775
00:49:57,666 --> 00:50:02,833
Looking at them, it is not hard to believe that they would
go to any lengths to prove that Surya Prakash is innocent.

776
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:08,500
We have come to find that the C.I Kishore hasn’t allowed anyone to meet
Surya Prakash, who continues to be held at the police station.

777
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:24,208
Reddy…

778
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:27,583
…none of the other cases took such a lot of time.

779
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:31,958
Get him dressed neatly.

780
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,000
I have some work to do with him tomorrow.

781
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:55,625
This is the weapon that was used
by the murderer for the crime.

782
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,166
Reddy!
-Sir.

783
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:00,958
Call the witnesses.

784
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:01,625
Come...

785
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:03,708
Namaste, sir.

786
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,708
What are your names?

787
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:05,416
Pandu, sir.

788
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,166
Sreenu, sir.

789
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:07,666
Get their signatures.

790
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,583
Sign here.

791
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:18,625
This is the shirt that was worn
by the murderer during the time of murder.

792
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:42,541
Is there a defense lawyer who is going
to argue his case here?

793
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:43,791
Yes, your honor.

794
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:46,500
Okay, proceed.

795
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:47,750
Your honor...

796
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:52,333
I request you to grant me some time
to familiarize myself with the case.

797
00:51:56,875 --> 00:52:01,125
I am ordering Bandi Surya Prakash into
the remand of the police for a period of 14 days.

798
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:02,250
Madam...

799
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,500
Madam, they have put me in jail and thrashed me.

800
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,041
I am in no way connected to that knife or that shirt.

801
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:11,583
This is entirely the fabricated evidence
planned by the C.I Kishore.

802
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,916
Please, madam. Please.

803
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,291
Your lawyer will speak on behalf
of you and will meet you in the jail.

804
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,875
Whatever you wish to say,
please tell your lawyer.

805
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:26,125
The court orders the police to provide opportunities
for Surya Prakash’s lawyer to meet with him in the jail.

806
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:50,875
They have managed to conspire with my lawyer and
ensure that the court orders me to stay in remand for 14 days.

807
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,083
The day after I went into remand…

808
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:46,416
Son, why do we need an A/C?

809
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:47,916
Stop it, father.

810
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,125
It’s going to be very hot during this summer.
You wouldn’t be able to bear it…

811
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,541
There is no way.

812
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:26,125
It’s because I was in a desperate situation,
I framed you as the culprit in this case.

813
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,333
What’s the big deal?
Why can’t you admit to it?

814
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,500
14 years…

815
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,166
Since you are a very good man...

816
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:36,416
you would be able to get out of jail on account
of exemplary behavior, in a span of six to seven years.

817
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:38,250
But…

818
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,500
Your parents complicated this sweet deal.

819
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:44,000
That is why...

820
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:52,000
I lit my cigarette and calmly threw away
my match stick towards them.

821
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,041
Hey, Leave him.

822
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:57,875
Then...

823
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:01,625
I was a bit doubtful that they might survive.

824
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:04,166
And then I took out another cigarette…

825
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:06,333
….and another match stick…

826
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:16,916
How dare you lay your hand on our C.I Sir?

827
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:33,041
They killed my parents, brother.

828
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:40,208
They filed another case against me accusing me
of hitting police officers who were on duty.

829
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:50,333
Shouldn’t you have told the courts about this?

830
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:53,666
To prove that he killed my parents,
I need to go to the courts.

831
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:57,666
I felt that if I needed to kill him,
the only need to do is get out of this jail.

832
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,791
I tried to escape twice.

833
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,916
And then, another set of charges
were levied against me.

834
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:23,791
And I was booked in two more cases.

835
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:26,416
The uncle in my colony from
whom I borrowed the money…

836
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:28,416
I never gave him those ten lakhs.

837
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,083
And the one who I’ve never seen in my life…

838
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:34,125
I saw him murder Mr. Raja Gopal.

839
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:39,125
Since then, I don’t know if I am going to those courts for justice
or if I am just heading there for another adjournment.

840
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:43,916
I spent an entire year chasing the courts pavements
and watching the walls of the prison.

841
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,958
Meenakshi and her father came here to meet you.

842
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:56,625
Uncle, come.

843
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:07,833
How are you, young man?

844
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:12,750
I never imagined that
we would witness such a day.

845
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:17,750
She is hopeful that you would
return to us and keeps waiting.

846
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:26,333
How long should she wait when
we don’t know when you would be released?

847
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,000
It’s a good match.

848
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:35,000
The groom is a software engineer like you.

849
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:41,875
Even though he knew about your relationship,
he still agreed to marry her.

850
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:52,791
Your father is right, Meenakshi.

851
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,625
I don’t know when I will be released.

852
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,458
I don’t even know if I would ever be released.

853
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:04,541
Even when I am released, there is a difference between
returning home from work and returning from jail.

854
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,958
You shouldn’t be punished because of your love for me.

855
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,666
I wish you a happy married life in advance.

856
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:19,375
Didn’t you always say …
...that we need to have a story to tell our children?

857
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:23,250
Yes. Now you have that.

858
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:27,166
Bye!

859
00:59:32,041 --> 00:59:33,208
We shall take our leave, young man.

860
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:59,416
When they said that they wanted to come to the prison,
I thought they were here to talk to you.

861
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:02,208
I didn’t know that they would
take such a decision, cousin

862
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,375
What did you decide?

863
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,750
Decide on what?

864
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:10,250
Buddy, please don’t ever come
back here to meet me.

865
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:11,333
Cousin…

866
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:14,583
If Kishore finds out that you come here to meet me,
he might do something to you.

867
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:16,375
I will take care of all that, cousin.

868
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:17,500
Go inside.

869
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,708
All the people I’ve loved in my life are gone.

870
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,125
You are the only one that’s left.

871
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:30,041
When I get out of this case, come to pick me up.

872
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:32,375
If I die here…
-Cousin…

873
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,291
… come to take my dead body.

874
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:36,666
Please don’t tell me to stop coming here!

875
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:37,583
Cousin!

876
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:40,250
Cousin! I can’t live without seeing you.

877
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:43,333
Right from when we were young,
I never left your side.

878
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:44,583
I can’t do it!

879
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,291
Cousin!

880
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,500
Please try and understand me.
Please, cousin!

881
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:10,416
Ever since that day,
didn’t Santosh come to meet you?

882
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:14,291
Every time I went to the court,
I knew that he came to see me.

883
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:17,833
But he respected my decision
and ever since that day, we haven’t crossed paths.

884
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:35,083
After that, the media stopped writing about me.

885
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,958
The people have stopped talking about me.

886
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,666
The justice system had forgotten me.

887
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:42,791
It’s been five years since.

888
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:56,000
Surya...

889
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,958
someone is here to meet you.

890
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:03,375
What are you thinking?

891
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,833
It’s been five years since you’ve had a visitor.

892
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,958
Why don’t you meet them once?

893
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,875
Hi, I am Aadhya.
I am an advocate.

894
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:54,083
I have been studying your case
for the past six months.

895
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,958
I’ve come here to talk
to you about your bail.

896
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:00,458
Excuse me?

897
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:05,083
You’ve been patiently waiting
to be released for the past five years.

898
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,708
Don’t you have the patience to talk
to the lawyer who has come to talk to you?

899
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,916
Not just five years, I would even wait for ten years.

900
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,541
I will come out of the prison before I die.
And when I do, I will kill him.

901
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,750
Even though you are innocent,
You spent five years in prison.

902
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:21,000
Are you going to spend another
14 years in there after murdering him?

903
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,166
Anger only creates problems.

904
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,833
Thinking will provide solutions to the problems.

905
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:32,750
While playing cricket,
there was a small squabble that broke out.

906
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:35,541
My son cussed you.

907
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:38,416
In anger, your son has beaten our son.

908
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:40,791
I should be the one to apologize to you, Satyam.

909
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,916
Even if one hits in anger,
it’s still wrong.

910
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:44,125
Son…

911
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,541
Anger only creates problems.

912
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,708
Thinking will provide one
with solution to problems.

913
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:51,375
Don’t ever make a mistake in anger.

914
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,625
What do you want me to do
after I come out on bail?

915
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:59,708
The person who killed my parents roams around scot free.
You want me to exchange pleasantries with him?

916
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Take avenge.

917
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,833
That too using lawful and judicial methods.

918
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,250
Surya, the primary purpose of
Indian Penal code is not to punish.

919
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:10,750
It is also to serve justice.

920
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:15,708
Are there any sections in the Indian Penal code,
that serve justice?

921
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:16,375
Yes, it is there.

922
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:21,833
If any person is falsely accused and
sent to jail and released later on,

923
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,333
the case that he can file against those
who falsely accused and framed him...

924
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:25,750
is called Section 211.

925
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,708
That CI Kishore, is the one who framed you.

926
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:32,125
If you file a Section 211 case
against him in the court and win...

927
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:36,666
he would be sentenced to
the same amount of time that you served.

928
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:38,833
That’s the power of section 211.

929
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:44,041
What else is there to think about?

930
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:45,958
Do you know what your father’s last words were?

931
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,916
My son should be released from jail as an innocent.

932
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:52,875
That C.I should be held as an accused in the courts of law.

933
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:57,833
What do you want me to do now?

934
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:03,916
Please sign the bail petition.

935
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:06,500
I will tell you what needs to be done
after you get out of the jail.

936
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,625
At last, you have succeeded to get bail to Surya.

937
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:30,166
Durga Rao?

938
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:31,041
Sir.

939
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,208
Take her to Surya’s cell.

940
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:33,875
Sure, sir.

941
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,541
Okay, sir.

942
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,458
Madam, Please come.

943
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,458
Madam, you seem to embody the divine
who has come to rescue Surya Prakash.

944
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,875
I am very happy.

945
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,208
When I asked you why you are hitting him,
you dare hit me?

946
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,416
Someone is hitting our guy.
Come, let’s go and deal with it.

947
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:50,583
Come, let’s go.

948
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,250
Hey! Why are you hitting us?

949
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,208
Tell me.

950
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,125
Why are you hitting our guy?

951
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,291
Stop it! Stop!

952
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:40,041
Brother! Brother!
Please don't hit them.

953
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:41,500
You are getting out of here after five years.

954
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,458
If you hit them... your bail will be cancelled.

955
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,125
Brother, please listen to me.

956
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,375
Brother, please.
Listen to me once.

957
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,875
Let him go!

958
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:56,875
No, Brother!

959
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,375
Please don't hit him.

960
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,541
Brother!

961
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:19,958
Don't hit them.

962
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,041
Stop it! Stop!

963
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,000
Please Bro...

964
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:49,208
He will spend the rest of his life in jail, Madam!

965
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,583
I exactly want the same!

966
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:59,958
You sent me in jail to get Surya out of jail.

967
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:04,625
You asked me to record everything that happens there
through this button camera.

968
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:08,125
When Surya’s bail was cancelled,
you said that you wanted exactly that!

969
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,041
Why did you say that, sister?

970
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:14,875
Upload the entire footage onto
social media through a fake IP.

971
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,916
A video has been trending in
social media these days.

972
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,916
What happened to Surya Prakash, who has been
serving a sentence for the past five years for the murder of Mr. Raja Gopal...

973
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:30,583
when he was about to be released
on bail within a span of few hours?

974
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:32,291
Let’s take a look at the video to find out.

975
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:36,125
Brother, seems you got the bail.

976
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,458
You are very happy, right?

977
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,958
I will be out in two days.

978
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:44,000
Let’s celebrate it thoroughly.

979
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:47,083
We are going to be hosted with lots of parties
and plenty of good food and a lot of celebration.

980
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:50,708
Who...?

981
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:52,375
Brother!

982
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:53,458
Brother... they are doing intentionally.
-He is hitting me.

983
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,000
Brother, come out.
-Why are you hitting him?

984
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,166
Brother, why are you hitting our guy?
-Brother… come out.

985
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,541
Brother, come out.

986
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:00,333
Brother, come out.

987
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:01,708
Let’s get out.
-Why are you hitting us?

988
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:02,791
Come out.

989
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:03,750
Why are you hitting?

990
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,416
Don't hit him.

991
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:07,625
No... don't hit him.

992
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:09,250
Don't hit him.

993
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,458
Bro... don't hit him.

994
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:13,416
Hey, why are you hitting him?

995
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:14,208
Bro...

996
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,583
Brother, please don’t hit him.

997
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:17,833
Brother! Please, please.

998
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,541
Please, brother.

999
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:20,375
Stop it.

1000
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:22,583
Brother, please don’t hit him.
Please, please.

1001
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:28,666
What is the Department of Prisons doing
when there is such a big violation of human rights?

1002
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:31,208
How are the Human Rights groups going to react to this?

1003
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:35,041
Human Rights officer Prithvi Narayan is with us on Live.

1004
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,375
Let’s ask him and find out.

1005
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,083
I just saw the video.

1006
01:11:38,583 --> 01:11:40,958
We will definitely go to the prison immediately
and take appropriate action.

1007
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:45,000
We will also meet Mr. Surya Prakash and
find out his version of the events and other details...

1008
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:46,625
and submit a report to the government.

1009
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:48,958
Sister...

1010
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:50,916
did you know that this would happen?

1011
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:56,000
I knew that they would do something to
make sure that Surya doesn’t get out of prison.

1012
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:57,875
What if this didn’t happen?

1013
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:00,166
He would have gotten bail and come out.

1014
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:04,375
Is this incident to our advantage?

1015
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,083
Yes, it would strengthen the case.

1016
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,666
If you had come five years ago,
Surya wouldn’t have gone through all this.

1017
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:15,041
If I had gotten my Law degree five years ago,
I wouldn’t have let Surya suffer this fate, Santhosh.

1018
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,166
The prison is spread across 30 acres.

1019
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,875
There are 300 people guarding it.

1020
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,750
There are a hundred CCTV cameras there.

1021
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:31,250
Someone took a video of jail without
your knowledge, in your own domain.

1022
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,541
What were you doing?

1023
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:35,833
If you had let him go...

1024
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:38,541
he would have gotten out and gone about his business.

1025
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:40,125
Why did you take this unnecessary step?

1026
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,375
I was worried he might do something
to you after he gets out.

1027
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,541
So I used my men to….

1028
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:44,875
He might do something to me?

1029
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:50,250
Even before that thought crosses his head,
we would have disposed him off without any trace.

1030
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,875
The Human Rights Commission
is going to come to the prison.

1031
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:54,416
If they reprimand you, take it.

1032
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:56,666
If they suspend you,
obey them and sit at home.

1033
01:12:57,625 --> 01:13:00,666
If my name comes out…

1034
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:04,750
Hello, sir.
-Are you a jailer?

1035
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:05,208
Yes, sir.

1036
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,000
Well, the fight broke out ….
-We saw all that on the video.

1037
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:08,875
Where is Mr. Surya Prakash?

1038
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:10,958
I am sorry, Mr. Surya Prakash.

1039
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,166
We are sad to see that you were
attacked in that manner.

1040
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,583
We will take definitive action against
all the concerned officials.

1041
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:19,750
Please sign these papers.

1042
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:22,500
We will recommend to the courts that
you be given bail immediately..

1043
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,375
Sir, even after all this,
you are still stuck on bail?

1044
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,666
There is a procedure for everything, Surya Prakash.

1045
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:29,916
A person takes nine months to be born into this world.

1046
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:33,375
But, why are they taking such a long time
to serve justice to me?

1047
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,416
If I have committed a crime, punish me.

1048
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,125
If not, please release me.

1049
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:44,791
The Human Rights Commission has submitted a report...

1050
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:48,041
to the government to hand over
Mr. Surya Prakash’s case to Fast Track courts.

1051
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:52,708
Will Surya Prakash, who has been languishing in jail
for the past five years, be able to finally see some justice?

1052
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:53,541
Let’s watch.

1053
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:01,666
Public prosecutor, please proceed.

1054
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:03,583
Your honor...

1055
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:06,416
it’s been five years since Raja Gopal’s murder.

1056
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:11,500
We have submitted all the necessary evidence to show that
this Bandi Surya Prakash had committed the murder.

1057
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,375
I request the honorable court...

1058
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:18,458
to examine the evidence and
sentence the accused appropriately.

1059
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:20,791
Anything from defense lawyer?

1060
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:22,458
Good morning, your honor.

1061
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,375
I request your permission for cross examination.

1062
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:26,958
Yes, granted.

1063
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,083
Obliged, your honor.

1064
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:32,416
They have shown the motive of murder to be the
ten lakhs amount taken by my client.

1065
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:36,125
But they haven’t been able
to prove the origin of that amount.

1066
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:39,458
Even though they have found the
Accused no. 1 five years ago,

1067
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,541
I wonder how long will they take
to find the Accused no. 2?

1068
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:42,458
Objection, your honor.

1069
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,333
The police are conducting the investigation.

1070
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:46,166
They will nab the Accused no. 2
in this case, very soon.

1071
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:50,291
Then, why is the public prosecutor demanding
that my client be punished immediately?

1072
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:53,583
Your honor...

1073
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:58,916
the police need to submit all the efforts they have undertaken
to catch the Accused no. 2, as a chain of events to this court.

1074
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,583
Why is it that they haven’t submitted it?

1075
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:02,541
Anything to say?

1076
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,125
The investigation is still going on, sir.

1077
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,458
We need some more time.

1078
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:06,916
How much longer will you take?

1079
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:07,583
Sir…

1080
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:12,875
Your honor, it’s clear from this that
there is no one who ordered a hit on the victim.

1081
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,083
Objection, your honor.

1082
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:15,416
Objection overruled.

1083
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:18,625
Your honor, I am appealing to you.

1084
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:21,458
This is entirely a false allegation against my client.

1085
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:23,916
I request you to please note this point, your honor.

1086
01:15:26,666 --> 01:15:27,208
Your honor...

1087
01:15:27,458 --> 01:15:31,416
the police have recovered this shirt and
claimed that it was used during the murder.

1088
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:33,791
When the police arrested my client...

1089
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:38,208
They submitted circumstantial
evidence of CCTV footage to the court.

1090
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:43,208
The police argue that my client had scouted
and trailed the deceased, three times and murdered him.

1091
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,791
Your honor, my client had been in
the same shirt throughout the day.

1092
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:49,916
Would it necessary for my client to change into
a different shirt just ten minutes before the murder?

1093
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:50,958
Objection, your honor.

1094
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:54,166
The accused must have wanted to lead the
police astray and so, could have done this.

1095
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:58,000
Public prosecutor, we would know within
a few minutes who led whom astray.

1096
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,750
Please wait.

1097
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:00,708
Your honor...

1098
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:02,166
there is a report in front of you.

1099
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:05,000
The shirt recovered from the police is XXL.

1100
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:06,958
My client’s shirt size is L.

1101
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:15,125
He went to the diagnostic center in the morning and
to the hospital in the evening for his mother’s treatment.

1102
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:16,208
He did not do that to scout and
murder the victim.

1103
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,166
Your honor...

1104
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:25,625
I would like your permission to cross examine the forensic examiner,
Rajendra Prasad, who gave the forensic report.

1105
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,625
Permission Granted.

1106
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:31,166
According to your report, the knife was stabbed three times
in the victim's chest with a depth of 9 inches.

1107
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,458
And, in the back, it was two times
and lodged 8 inches deep.

1108
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:34,166
Is that right?

1109
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:34,750
Yes.

1110
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,625
Is Surya Prakash right-hander or left-hander?

1111
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:37,458
Right hander.

1112
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:39,666
His right-hand finger prints matched.

1113
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:40,916
Thank you. You may leave.

1114
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:43,833
Your honor...

1115
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:49,625
when my client was playing cricket when he was 12 years old,
his right-hand thumb was injured during a catch.

1116
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:53,875
Even though the injury is healed,
his right-handed thumb cannot grip things well.

1117
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,583
This is the certificate from the
government doctor and the X ray, your honor.

1118
01:17:02,583 --> 01:17:05,416
How is it possible for my client who
doesn’t have proper grip in his right hand...

1119
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:09,791
to stab the victim three times in the front, 9 inches deep,
and two times in the back 8 inches deep?

1120
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:16,125
Hence, technically and medically
it has been proven as a false allegation.

1121
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:17,416
Any objection, public prosecutor?

1122
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:20,083
No.

1123
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:25,250
I request your permission to
cross-examine the eye-witness Chandraiah.

1124
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:26,333
Granted.

1125
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:28,333
Namaste, sir.

1126
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,208
Namaste.

1127
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,708
Namaste.

1128
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,625
Did you see Surya Prakash killing Raja Gopal?

1129
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,875
I saw it.
-How?

1130
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:36,375
With my eyes.

1131
01:17:36,708 --> 01:17:39,250
Was it when you had your glasses on or off?

1132
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:41,416
I’ve had eye sight issues forever.

1133
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:44,541
I cannot go even take a shower without them.

1134
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:46,333
Note this point, your honor.

1135
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,791
Take a look at this video.

1136
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:52,958
On the day of the murder, he was at the
protest corner, participating in the protests.

1137
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:55,333
A baton charge were used on the protesters that day.

1138
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:57,333
and his spectacles were broken during the protests.

1139
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,916
They took Chandraiah into police custody
at 12 o’clock in the noon and...

1140
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:03,541
released him at 5 in the evening.

1141
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:09,791
He went to the eye hospital to get his eyes checked,
ordered a new frame and paid 1700 rupees there.

1142
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,416
Those new frames arrived after two days.

1143
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,333
This is the copy of the bill, your honor.

1144
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:24,333
Chandraiah, who cannot even bathe
without his glasses on...

1145
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,666
did not have his glasses on that night.

1146
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:30,833
Isn’t it surprising that he witnessed
the murder of Raja Gopal from 20 feet away...

1147
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:34,333
and the police submitted his testimony as evidence?

1148
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:40,958
Amidst such false allegations,
the public prosecutor wishes for you to sentence my client?

1149
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:48,250
My client, despite his innocence,
has been serving his sentence as an undertrial prisoner.

1150
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:51,250
I request you to release him from all charges.

1151
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,375
That's all, your honor.

1152
01:18:57,083 --> 01:19:00,833
The court will pass its judgement
on the 4th of this month.

1153
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:54,333
The court believes that the accusations
against Mr. Surya Prakash...

1154
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:57,708
in the case of the murder of Mr. Raja Gopal to be false.

1155
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:07,791
The court dismisses the four cases against him.

1156
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:10,750
The court expresses its dismay at
Surya Prakash being in prison...

1157
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,708
for the past five years as an under trail accused.

1158
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:15,833
The court releases Bandi Surya Prakash as
he is innocent of the crimes he is accused of.

1159
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:21,791
Thank you, your honor.

1160
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:12,583
Cousin!

1161
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:25,791
Let's go.

1162
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,666
Sir, you’ve gotten out of the
prison after five years.

1163
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,708
Brother, brother…

1164
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:48,541
Please move.
Not right now…not now.

1165
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:50,041
Please…please…please.

1166
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,208
You’ve lost all you dear ones.
Where are you headed?

1167
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:52,375
Brother, not right now.

1168
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,041
Please, step back.

1169
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:55,833
Shall we leave?

1170
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:56,458
Just wait a while.

1171
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,875
This is the first case that I’ve argued and won.

1172
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,416
If you could provide me with a copy of the judgement,
I would publish this on RTV as an exclusive.

1173
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,916
Judgement copy hasn’t come yet.

1174
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:20,916

1195
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:51,208
There were a variety of reactions from people around.

1196
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:52,666
But you were an exception.

1197
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:54,250
Aadhya is here, right?

1198
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:00,416
Aadhya...?

1199
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:03,625
She is the daughter born out of his vision.

1200
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:19,166
We were satisfied that the person who
committed the murder ended up behind bars.

1201
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:25,333
But only after Aadhya came to us, we realized that
you did not commit the murder and were instead framed.

1202
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:32,583
Raja Gopal fought really hard for all those
who share the same fate as you.

1203
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:37,083
When they unjustly framed
you in this murder case.

1204
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:45,500
Aadhya felt that Raja Gopal’s efforts
and your life mustn’t end there.

1205
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,791
With regards the question
of who killed him and why...

1206
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:57,541
the section 211 case that
you are taking on will give you your answers.

1207
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:10,000
Hey, Surya!

1208
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,000
What a timing! I was thinking of calling you.

1209
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:14,500
I just went to Mr. Raja Gopal’s place earlier.

1210
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:16,958
Did they tell you that I was a torch bearer?

1211
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:18,666
Thank you, Lawyer.

1212
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:20,750
Thank you for starting the
section 211 fight with me.

1213
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:22,750
The actual fight begins now, Surya.

1214
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:28,333
Because he gave false evidence, levied false allegations against you
and robbed you of five years of your life,

1215
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:30,833
we are going to file a 211 case against Kishore.

1216
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:33,458
Let’s do that but let’s give it some time.

1217
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:37,291
If we file a 211 case,
it must become a sensational news.

1218
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,541
He must lose his mind.

1219
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:41,250
Before he can react, we must have
the entire evidence in our hands.

1220
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:42,791
Cousin, have you gone crazy?

1221
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:45,583
That policeman put you in jail for
five years even though you were innocent.

1222
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:47,291
And now, you want to
file a case against a policeman?

1223
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:49,291
If you lost the case,
he will never leave you in peace.

1224
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,708
Please, cousin. No.

1225
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:52,833
Let’s forget about all this,
and work hard and live in peace.

1226
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:55,375
Shall I let him go even though
he is responsible for my parent’s death?

1227
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:57,458
Should I forget my dad’s last wish?

1228
01:29:59,625 --> 01:30:01,041
He killed my parents...

1229
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:02,833
He is also responsible for me losing my love.

1230
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:04,291
He damaged my entire life.

1231
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,208
There are so many like me...

1232
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:08,666
who lost their parents...

1233
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:10,208
...parents who lost their sons...

1234
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,125
Things like this shouldn’t repeat themselves.

1235
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,375
Everyone thought this was the end of my life...

1236
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:17,166
but, it's just begun.

1237
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,583
Cousin, it’s not an easy task taking him on.

1238
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,166
Please, cousin. Let it go.

1239
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:22,500
Buddy, do not mistake this for revenge.

1240
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,583
Think of this 211 as the right given
by the Indian Penal Code for the commoner.

1241
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:31,750
Okay.

1242
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:33,125
My boat is always hitched to yours.

1243
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,250
Tell me now, lawyer.
What should we do?

1244
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:40,291
I can handle the murder weapon
and the forensic reports.

1245
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:42,291
But the eye witness for this case is Chandraiah.

1246
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:45,375
He is very important for this case.

1247
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:46,750
Right.

1248
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:54,500
I will make sure he tells the truth about
how Kishore influenced him and got him to lie.

1249
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:56,583
Here!

1250
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,166
Give me a half pint bottle of my regular brand.

1251
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,458
I have to go.
Hurry up and give it.

1252
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:43,458
Are you kidnapping me?

1253
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:47,458
You will be booked under Section 363
and will have to serve 7 years in prison.

1254
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:50,041
Idiot!
If I could whack....

1255
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,416
I will thrash you....you fraud!

1256
01:31:53,416 --> 01:31:54,500
This is manhandling.

1257
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,208
You will be booked under section 323

1258
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:58,208
You will be done.
You will serve a year in jail.

1259
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:01,541
You old fool!
-Hold on!

1260
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:02,916
This is attempted murder.

1261
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:05,416
You will be booked under section 307.
You will be jailed for ten years.

1262
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:07,583
Listen...

1263
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,666
you’ve been in prison for five years
and you were just recently released.

1264
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:12,250
Do you need to do this?

1265
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:14,125
Is this really necessary?

1266
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:22,833
I understood.

1267
01:32:23,833 --> 01:32:27,875
I know that you know that
I have a weakness for alcohol.

1268
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:28,416
No.

1269
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:30,250
I won’t drink.

1270
01:32:31,416 --> 01:32:31,833
No.

1271
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:34,791
No matter how long you wait, I will not drink.

1272
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:38,750
I won’t drink.

1273
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:40,166
I won’t drink.

1274
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:41,833
No, I won’t.

1275
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:04,375
Kishore is my saviour.

1276
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,083
...I meant for me...for me.

1277
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:14,333
I’ve been working for him for ten years.

1278
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:17,208
He really trusts me.

1279
01:33:17,708 --> 01:33:20,291
No matter what kind of work it is,
he would ask me to do it.

1280
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:28,375
You should kill this Rajgopal.

1281
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:30,041
Okay, sir.

1282
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:31,916
Chandraiah?

1283
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:38,791
As a bonus, I would drop the
criminal records on the both of you.

1284
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:45,708
After you kill him, stay in the factory shed.

1285
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:47,208
Okay sir.

1286
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:50,291
Whatever you need,
Chandriah will take care of it.

1287
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,000
Go on.

1288
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:56,375
Chandraih?

1289
01:33:56,541 --> 01:33:57,000
Sir.

1290
01:33:57,791 --> 01:34:01,208
I heard that Shiv Ram is going to conduct
a strike at the Dharna Chowk tomorrow.

1291
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:06,083
Land poacher Nagender
-Must be arrested! (Slogans)

1292
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:07,666
I need a minimum of the two of you for the job...

1293
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:10,541
If you need more, it’s your call.

1294
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,458
But...

1295
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,000
Must be distributed to the poor. (Slogans)

1296
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:16,708
Blood must be spilled.

1297
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:19,000
Nallagandla lands.....
-Must be distributed to the poor. (Slogans)

1298
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,791
Land poacher Nagender
-Must be arrested! (Slogans)

1299
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:22,125
Stop, my friends.

1300
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:23,125
Stop it.

1301
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:25,208
Don't throw stones.

1302
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:26,583
Stop, my friends!

1303
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:27,333
Stop it.

1304
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:35,750
I lost my spectacles.

1305
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:37,625
I lost my spectacles.

1306
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:38,500
I can't see without my glasses.

1307
01:34:38,666 --> 01:34:41,625
That very night, the both of them killed Mr. Raja Gopal.

1308
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:07,541
Here, this is your liquor and this is your food.

1309
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:09,458
Enjoy yourselves.

1310
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:10,458
Uncle...

1311
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:13,541
you’ve been feeding us and giving us
a drink for the past three days.

1312
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,375
But today, you must drink with us.

1313
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:15,875
Come.

1314
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,541
My capacity to drink is limited to four pegs.

1315
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:22,500
If I drink more than that,
the good in me comes out.

1316
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:30,666
What happened, uncle?
Why are you crying?

1317
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:34,375
You are such lovely people.

1318
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:42,458
Kishore is getting you guys
ready to become the sacrificial lambs.

1319
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,208
What are you saying, uncle?

1320
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:47,916
Guys...

1321
01:35:49,125 --> 01:35:52,208
the one you killed is a very important man.

1322
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:54,750
Kishore wants to kill the both of you...

1323
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:58,250
and then close the case.

1324
01:36:01,625 --> 01:36:07,333
That is why he took that murdered weapon
and your blood-soaked shirt.

1325
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:10,333
He is going to kill the both of you.

1326
01:36:10,458 --> 01:36:12,791
He is going to do it tomorrow.

1327
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:18,208
You guys must stay alive.

1328
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:21,750
That very night, the both of them escaped.

1329
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:23,083
Hello?

1330
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:24,333
Chandraiah, Tell me.

1331
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:25,708
Sir, the both of them have escaped!

1332
01:36:25,875 --> 01:36:26,916
Put the phone down, you...!

1333
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:32,083
Kishore’s plan was ruined.

1334
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:33,958
And there was a lot of
pressure from his superiors.

1335
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:35,416
He is talking to the commissioner.

1336
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:36,916
Close the case quickly.
-Sir...

1337
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:43,750
He framed you for that murder and sent you to jail.

1338
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:50,000
He searched hard and finally caught
the murderers Krishna and Suresh...

1339
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and shot them dead.

1340
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:55,416
He made me burn their bodies.

1341
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,625
I know only this much.

1342
01:36:58,250 --> 01:36:58,833
That’s all.

1343
01:37:08,375 --> 01:37:10,416
Lawyer, let’s file the case now.

1344
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,666
Mr. Surya Prakash has once
again gone to the courts.

1345
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:19,666
He filed a case with the court against
ACP Kishore under section 211.

1346
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:22,625
ACP...

1347
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,958
I never thought you would need a lawyer, brother.

1348
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:31,125
When Surya Prakash was released...

1349
01:37:31,916 --> 01:37:34,166
he looked at me with anger in his eyes.

1350
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:37,541
I was under the impression that he is
angry because he was in a helpless state.

1351
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:38,750
But...

1352
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:43,166
I didn’t realise that he was warning me.

1353
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,958
That lawyer....

1354
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,375
...she is wet behind the ears.

1355
01:37:48,916 --> 01:37:51,125
Just gotten her degree a while back
and became a big shot.

1356
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:53,625
She is just now learning how to tie her show laces.

1357
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:54,791
Don’t you worry about her.

1358
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:57,666
Chandraiah!

1359
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,083
Chandraiah!

1360
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,458
Why do we need him now?

1361
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:03,833
He has an important role to play, brother.

1362
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:09,125
He must come to the court and declare that you didn’t influence him
in anyway and you were in no way connected.

1363
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:11,458
Please call him. Hurry.

1364
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:14,250
I am going to train him on what needs
to be said in the court.

1365
01:38:22,416 --> 01:38:23,208
Switched off?

1366
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:26,958
Brother...

1367
01:38:29,416 --> 01:38:31,583
Surya is a step ahead of you.

1368
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:41,333
Surya, he cannot confess unless he is drunk.

1369
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,750
And, even if he tells the truth while he is drunk,
the courts will not believe it.

1370
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:46,500
Will he say anything at all in the courts?

1371
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:53,875
It’s because of people like you that thousands
of innocent people are languishing in the court.

1372
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:55,791
Try telling the truth once and see...

1373
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:58,208
how many lives change.

1374
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:04,333
If tomorrow you look at him
and do not tell the truth...

1375
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:06,625
Remember that I am not new to jail...

1376
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,625
and I am not new to being branded a murderer.

1377
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:14,958
I will tell the truth.

1378
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,833
If I tell the truth...

1379
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:20,916
I will be booked under section 120B
and sentenced to 6 months in jail.

1380
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:21,750
But...

1381
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:23,583
thankfully, I will be alive.

1382
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:24,875
So, I will tell the truth.

1383
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,458
Get him to the court on time.

1384
01:39:28,791 --> 01:39:29,416
Alright.

1385
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:41,000
Proceed.

1386
01:39:45,166 --> 01:39:45,916
Your honor...

1387
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:50,666
there is a small request before we
talk about the case and its details.

1388
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:54,041
The police department...

1389
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,208
needs to practice certain procedures.

1390
01:39:56,875 --> 01:39:58,458
When a crime is committed...

1391
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:02,125
the police move and reach the location of the crime...

1392
01:40:02,166 --> 01:40:06,250
collect the evidences
and according to section 51 and 53...

1393
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:11,416
they take the accused and the suspects into their custody,
and then produce them in front of the court.

1394
01:40:11,791 --> 01:40:13,625
The arguments and
counterarguments that follow...

1395
01:40:13,833 --> 01:40:15,916
and the decision taken by the judge...

1396
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:17,750
are not at all in the purview
of the police department.

1397
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:22,916
The same exact thing happened
in the case of Surya Prakash.

1398
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:27,375
The day after he went into the police custody,
his parents committed suicide and passed away.

1399
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:30,916
After a year, the women who was
in love with him, left him.

1400
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,458
It’s because he was frustrated
and did not know what to do,

1401
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:41,250
he held a grudge against ACP Kishore for
sending him unjustly to the prison.

1402
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:46,000
And thus, lodged a section 211 case against my client.

1403
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:51,625
If everyone files a case against the
police officers who arrest the criminals...

1404
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:56,458
how will the policemen, lawyers
and judges be able to work?

1405
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,208
That is why, I ask you to dismiss
this case immediately...

1406
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:03,583
and save the precious time of this court.

1407
01:41:03,583 --> 01:41:04,125
Thank you.

1408
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:06,708
Objection, your honor.

1409
01:41:07,333 --> 01:41:13,000
The reason why my client filed this 211 case
was to separate the wheat from the chaff.

1410
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:16,375
The fast-track court...

1411
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:19,791
released my client and expressed its
displeasure of handling this case.

1412
01:41:20,166 --> 01:41:22,500
In police records, jail records,
court records...

1413
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,250
public media, social media,
electronic media, web media...

1414
01:41:25,416 --> 01:41:29,000
it is mentioned that the accused is Bandi Surya Prakash.

1415
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,125
Can you erase all that?

1416
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:37,625
Do you have any proper evidence?

1417
01:41:37,666 --> 01:41:38,208
Yes, sir.

1418
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:43,166
I would like to call upon the first eye-witness,
Chandraiah into the witness box, your honor.

1419
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,833
Chandraiah!

1420
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,833
Chandraiah!

1421
01:41:49,541 --> 01:41:50,375
Chandraiah!

1422
01:41:58,208 --> 01:41:59,041
Chandraiah!

1423
01:41:59,250 --> 01:42:00,333
Hurry!

1424
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:32,416
He is not here, Sir.

1425
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:36,125
What’s happening?
Didn’t he come?

1426
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:38,416
I am sorry, your honor.

1427
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:40,416
Will you please grant me four days, your honor?

1428
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,791
Objection, your honor.

1429
01:42:41,916 --> 01:42:43,958
She intentionally wasting court time.

1430
01:42:43,958 --> 01:42:45,500
Why does she ask for four days again?

1431
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,833
Please dismiss the case immediately.

1432
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:48,833
Objection, overruled.

1433
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:53,791
Granted.

1434
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,208
Thank you, your honor.

1435
01:43:14,166 --> 01:43:15,041
They didn't pick my calls...

1436
01:43:15,375 --> 01:43:16,791
Don't know what happened.

1437
01:43:30,083 --> 01:43:32,750
Indian Penal Code must be written
by a very good guy.

1438
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:35,000
Perhaps that’s the reason
why you were released.

1439
01:43:36,666 --> 01:43:39,000
Actually, someone like me should have written it.

1440
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:41,208
You would never have been released.

1441
01:43:42,041 --> 01:43:43,625
How could you file a case
against a police officer?

1442
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:46,291
What is it?

1443
01:43:47,333 --> 01:43:48,416
211.

1444
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:50,416
Yes, Section 211.

1445
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:55,250
Law here is meant to be used against the weak.

1446
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Law cannot touch the powerful.

1447
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:04,083
Actually, even though I didn’t know you,
I put you in jail for 5 years.

1448
01:44:06,416 --> 01:44:08,791
And you knew about me
and still filed a case against me.

1449
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:14,458
Count your days.

1450
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,166
We will catch those criminals.

1451
01:45:04,208 --> 01:45:05,083
Hello, Kishore.

1452
01:45:05,083 --> 01:45:05,750
Sir.

1453
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:06,583
Is everything okay?

1454
01:45:06,583 --> 01:45:07,708
Everything from my side is good.

1455
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:10,541
And, hats off to your acting skills.

1456
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,958
Sir, I am already tensed that those two have escaped.

1457
01:45:13,958 --> 01:45:15,375
And the commissioner calls me and….

1458
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:16,875
….he is on my case.

1459
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:19,166
Arrest some Tom, Dick or Harry
and frame him.

1460
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:21,791
The entire media’s attention
would be on that guy.

1461
01:45:22,541 --> 01:45:25,500
We proclaim Bandi Surya Prakash’s innocence
and release him from all charges.

1462
01:45:26,041 --> 01:45:28,708
After he was released,
he’s just been minding his own business.

1463
01:45:28,833 --> 01:45:30,083
I don’t think he would connect the dots to you.

1464
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:31,875
Why would he?

1465
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,333
If he tries anything, I am sure
you will frame him in another case.

1466
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:35,833
Sir…

1467
01:45:35,958 --> 01:45:37,333
What is this Section 211 case?

1468
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:38,625
I will take care of it, sir.

1469
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,625
This isn’t a case that pertains to your police station.

1470
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:43,333
If something goes wrong,
we will end up in prison.

1471
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:46,625
I am sending my lawyer Satya Murthy.
He will guide you on what to do.

1472
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:50,291
Chandraiah is under the protection of Surya, sir.

1473
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,416
If he comes to the court tomorrow,
the case will turn in their favor.

1474
01:45:53,666 --> 01:45:58,291
If they are to attend the court,
they must cross me.

1475
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:29,666
A person named Chandraiah has been
violently murdered in Janatha Bar in Chanda Nagar.

1476
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:34,583
He is the primary witness in the section
211 case filed by Mr Surya Prakash.

1477
01:46:34,916 --> 01:46:41,375
We have reports that the police are investigating thoroughly
to figure out the culprits behind the murder and the motive.

1478
01:46:42,708 --> 01:46:44,041
This is Kishore’s doing, Aadhya.

1479
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:46,958
If Chandraiah confessed...

1480
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,583
everyone would know that Kishore
is the culprit of Rajagopal's murder.

1481
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,083
That is why he killed Chandraiah.

1482
01:46:51,833 --> 01:46:55,291
If that’s the case, what possible reason
did he have to get Mr. Raja Gopal killed?

1483
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:02,875
The entire mystery is connected
to Mr. Raja Gopal’s murder.

1484
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:09,791
If we need to know that, we must find out
what happened before his murder.

1485
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:13,291
We must find out about Mr. Raja Gopal’s
initiative five years ago...

1486
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:18,625
the FIRs registered by Kishore,
also, the high-profile court cases then,

1487
01:47:19,041 --> 01:47:23,166
articles in the newspapers at that time, debates on Television,
I need every minute detail about these things.

1488
01:49:03,166 --> 01:49:04,791
Why did you kill Chandraiah?!

1489
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,583
That drunkard...

1490
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:09,708
told them that I was the one
who got Raja Gopal killed.

1491
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,958
What is the guarantee that
he wouldn’t tell others?

1492
01:49:13,041 --> 01:49:15,000
You do know that he is very
important to the case, right?

1493
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,916
If Surya demanded that an enquiry commission
be launched to investigate this, what will you do?

1494
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:25,500
Let’s do exactly what we did five years ago.

1495
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:35,416
How is that possible?

1496
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:37,291
How can the government purchase its own land?

1497
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:38,416
This is a very big scam.

1498
01:49:38,666 --> 01:49:41,916
The 100 acres of land pooled for the
purpose of an electronics hub...

1499
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:44,708
has been divided and distributed to the poor.

1500
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:49,250
And now, they are purchasing that very land from the poor
at a price that is four times the market price.

1501
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:51,916
Who are these poor people?
The workers of that party itself.

1502
01:49:52,041 --> 01:49:53,791
This was a bloody huge scam
running into thousands of crores.

1503
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:55,458
Who do you think is behind this, Mr. Siva Ram?

1504
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:56,666
Who else?

1505
01:49:56,916 --> 01:50:00,666
Those very people who handed over the land to the poor a year ago,
are the ones responsible for this scam.

1506
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:02,166
This is very evident.

1507
01:50:02,333 --> 01:50:05,000
We are going to protest against the
government along with the people.

1508
01:50:05,208 --> 01:50:07,416
Hope you do notice that Siva Ram.

1509
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,958
He has been shouting from the roof tops
about the land scam and demanding a CBI enquiry.

1510
01:50:13,458 --> 01:50:15,125
That Siva Ram is just like that.

1511
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:18,916
Until he finds something new to engage in,
he will be stuck with this topic.

1512
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:21,875
Shouldn’t we give him something
new to talk about?

1513
01:50:23,375 --> 01:50:24,416
Something new?

1514
01:50:25,208 --> 01:50:26,125
You must kill.

1515
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:28,250
Who?

1516
01:50:28,708 --> 01:50:30,000
Raja Gopal.

1517
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:34,250
Isn’t he the one constantly harping
on law and justice and people’s rights?

1518
01:50:35,041 --> 01:50:38,291
He holds a very good reputation amongst the people
and the poor have great regard for him, sir.

1519
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:40,333
How would killing him help us?

1520
01:50:40,625 --> 01:50:43,416
A great man’s death will make
people forget a lot of things.

1521
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:49,291
If Raja Gopal is killed, the entire media,
the people and even Siva Ram...

1522
01:50:49,625 --> 01:50:53,791
would be diverted from the land scam
and would talk about Raja Gopal’s murder.

1523
01:50:54,083 --> 01:50:54,750
So...

1524
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:58,958
devise a plan carefully to kill Raja Gopal.

1525
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:05,416
How can it to that?

1526
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:06,583
What is the government doing?

1527
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,083
Don’t leaders like us have any sort of security?

1528
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:12,000
We are going to question the government
and ensure that Raja Gopal’s murderer is brought to justice.

1529
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,041
To divert the attention from Nallagandla land scam...

1530
01:51:16,291 --> 01:51:19,083
they murdered Raja Gopal,
who was in no way connected to the issue.

1531
01:51:19,791 --> 01:51:21,958
The land scam faded into the background…

1532
01:51:23,166 --> 01:51:25,208
…and the murder became the top story.

1533
01:51:25,875 --> 01:51:27,791
And when they arrested me,
every channel telecasted news about me.

1534
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:28,833
It was the breaking news.

1535
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:32,041
The news about the land scam
didn’t even make it to district edition.

1536
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:37,625
By murdering Mr. Raja Gopal, they have made the people
forget about the hundreds of acres land scam.

1537
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:43,000
Who do you think is responsible for this?

1538
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:47,500
The people who distributed the land amongst the poor a year ago,
are the ones who are responsible for this scam.

1539
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:52,458
The one who distributed the land and the one responsible
for the scam is the Home minister, Mr. Nagendra Rao.

1540
01:51:52,458 --> 01:51:54,833
And along with him is that CI, Kishore.

1541
01:51:55,666 --> 01:51:58,750
Everything falls into place but
how do we prove it in the court?

1542
01:52:40,333 --> 01:52:45,041
Your assumption that Mr Raja Gopal was murdered to take
the spotlight away from Nallagandla Land scam is good.

1543
01:52:46,291 --> 01:52:49,791
But, the court doesn’t concern
itself with your assumptions.

1544
01:52:50,333 --> 01:52:51,791
It needs evidence.

1545
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:53,458
Exactly, your honor.

1546
01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:57,625
All this is an excuse to divert the case
and nothing more.

1547
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,166
Since the prime witness, Mr Chandriah is dead,

1548
01:53:00,166 --> 01:53:05,500
I request the court to not dwell anymore on this case
and waste its time, and dismiss the case immediately.

1549
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,083
Your honor.

1550
01:53:06,708 --> 01:53:13,083
There has never been any account of the case being
dismissed on account of the prime witness’s death, your honor.

1551
01:53:14,041 --> 01:53:15,208
If you would permit me...

1552
01:53:15,416 --> 01:53:20,708
I would like to cross-examine ACP Kishore,
the accused in this case.

1553
01:53:21,958 --> 01:53:22,708
Mr Kishore...

1554
01:53:23,083 --> 01:53:24,500
please come to the witness box.

1555
01:53:34,916 --> 01:53:36,416
Were you born rich or poor?

1556
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:38,291
Your ho….

1557
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:41,375
I was born rich.

1558
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:42,958
Note this point, your honor.

1559
01:53:43,208 --> 01:53:46,125
The government said the Nallagandla lands
were distributed to the poor.

1560
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:47,958
And, here you say that you are rich.

1561
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:52,041
So, how is it that your family members came to become
the owners of hundreds of acres of land there?

1562
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:57,500
Oh? You mean only you are rich
and the rest of the family is poor.

1563
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:09,375
These are the records which state that his
family members possess lands in that area.

1564
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:20,541
Objection, your honor.

1565
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:25,458
Is there any connection between that land scam
and that section 211 case here?

1566
01:54:26,416 --> 01:54:30,083
Junior Lawyer, Aadhya is over reaching with her conclusions
and diverting the attention of the court.

1567
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:32,500
Do you have a clarity about the case?

1568
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:33,583
Do you have some clarity?

1569
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:36,291
Senior most lawyer, Mr Satya Murthy...

1570
01:54:36,291 --> 01:54:39,625
If you could wait a while,
all those connections would be revealed.

1571
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:44,291
Is Mr Nagendra your relative?

1572
01:54:45,708 --> 01:54:46,291
No.

1573
01:54:47,458 --> 01:54:51,083
Every month, six lakhs are being deposited
from Nagendra account to your wife’s account.

1574
01:54:51,166 --> 01:54:52,625
Is that the bribe he gives you?

1575
01:54:55,833 --> 01:54:59,000
This is the bank statement
regarding this money, your honor.

1576
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:21,416
You said that there was no connection.
But looks like there is a strong connection.

1577
01:55:21,541 --> 01:55:24,791
You are unnecessarily involving
Mr Nagendra in this case.

1578
01:55:24,791 --> 01:55:29,166
When you lose the case tomorrow,
the court is going to take action against you and your client.

1579
01:55:29,166 --> 01:55:32,291
My client and I are ready for
any sort of punishment, your honor.

1580
01:55:38,833 --> 01:55:43,083
Four days ago, the witness Mr. Chandraiah
who was supposed to come to the court, did not.

1581
01:55:43,083 --> 01:55:47,083
There was message from
Mr Nagendra on Kishore’s phone.

1582
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:51,166
He immediately relaxed after seeing that message.

1583
01:55:51,916 --> 01:55:54,708
That recording was captured on that camera, your honor.

1584
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:01,791
I request the court to grant permission
for playing that recording, your honor.

1585
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:23,208
What’s up, Lawyer?

1586
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:25,958
Even you seem to be very relaxed in that video?

1587
01:56:26,291 --> 01:56:29,333
Looks like you were also informed that
Chandraiah wouldn’t be able to make it to the court?

1588
01:56:32,916 --> 01:56:37,000
After the court was adjourned,
Kishore messaged Nagendra.

1589
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:40,083
They call each other at least four times a day;

1590
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:41,166
like lovers.

1591
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:45,875
This is the call list related to that.

1592
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,875
If we get TRAI’s permission and obtain the
voices regarding this call list, from the network...

1593
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,750
the entire connection would be revealed, your honor.

1594
01:57:09,875 --> 01:57:11,666
Kindly give permission for call records.

1595
01:57:11,916 --> 01:57:14,250
Excuse me, your honor.
One small objection.

1596
01:57:15,166 --> 01:57:18,083
Mr Nagendra is an ex-home minister
and even a celebrity.

1597
01:57:18,458 --> 01:57:20,208
Kishore is a police officer.

1598
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:22,916
If we set aside the reason as to why
they spoke to each other...

1599
01:57:23,416 --> 01:57:27,541
On what authority does she ask for
the call records of ex-home minister?

1600
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:28,333
How is it possible?

1601
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:30,875
Is it truly necessary to get the
call records of ex-home minister?

1602
01:57:30,875 --> 01:57:32,791
How? How?
You tell me how?

1603
01:57:33,291 --> 01:57:36,208
Your honor, in 2015 Suresh Kalmadi case,

1604
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:39,916
CBI got the call data from TRAI through Delhi high court.

1605
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
These are the details regarding
that case, your honor.

1606
01:57:50,958 --> 01:57:57,625
Your honor, please order the location of Mr Kishore
from TRAI during Chandraiah’s murder.

1607
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,833
It’s because ex-home minister,
Mr Nagendra, is behind this entire operation,

1608
01:58:01,125 --> 01:58:06,333
I would like to request that the FIR be altered and
Mr Nagendra’s name be included in it, your honor.

1609
01:58:06,416 --> 01:58:07,458
Thank you, your honor.

1610
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:28,416
After examining all the details...

1611
01:58:29,166 --> 01:58:34,041
the court will decide on including
ex-Minister Mr Nagendra name in the FIR...

1612
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:38,708
and obtaining the records from
TRAI in the next session.

1613
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:40,916
The court is adjourned till tomorrow.

1614
01:59:01,125 --> 01:59:02,166
What’s up, lawyer?

1615
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:06,250
Will TRAI have a recording of
all the conversations we’ve had?

1616
01:59:08,375 --> 01:59:10,583
Records from five years ago will not be available, sir.

1617
01:59:11,708 --> 01:59:15,083
But records from the past six months
will definitely be available.

1618
01:59:15,625 --> 01:59:17,416
Damn it!
I wonder who all I spoke to!

1619
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:20,250
Did you ever talk to that women activist…

1620
01:59:20,375 --> 01:59:20,916
Shut it!

1621
01:59:22,625 --> 01:59:25,041
After I killed Raja Gopal, I killed a few others.

1622
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,333
I should have killed you.

1623
01:59:28,791 --> 01:59:32,083
Well, buy the judge and tell her to close the case.

1624
01:59:32,833 --> 01:59:35,000
Not all judges can be bought, sir.

1625
01:59:36,083 --> 01:59:40,708
If my forty-year political career comes under the
scrutiny of the courts, I will be ruined.

1626
01:59:41,916 --> 01:59:44,208
Well, there is only one way that remains.

1627
01:59:46,416 --> 01:59:50,375
If you could get her to go to the court
and make her withdraw the case…

1628
01:59:51,541 --> 01:59:52,250
That is enough.

1629
01:59:53,125 --> 01:59:53,583
How?

1630
01:59:54,708 --> 01:59:55,375
Make her fear death…..

1631
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:57,958
Show them fear of death.

1632
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:00,666
If she isn’t threatened?

1633
02:00:03,083 --> 02:00:03,750
Brother…

1634
02:00:48,791 --> 02:00:51,416
I don’t see any fear in your face.

1635
02:00:52,416 --> 02:00:53,958
You must be very strong.

1636
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:56,375
Let me show you.

1637
02:00:58,666 --> 02:01:02,250
But, I will show you something
that will hit you hard.

1638
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,250
After you got me here, instead of killing me,
you are indulging in a discussion.

1639
02:01:09,541 --> 02:01:11,708
That means you must know that you are losing.

1640
02:01:11,958 --> 02:01:14,125
You are going to instill fear in me?

1641
02:01:18,333 --> 02:01:19,833
You are very intelligent.

1642
02:01:20,625 --> 02:01:25,541
Alright, now that you know, take back the case.

1643
02:01:26,416 --> 02:01:28,875
What ever the amount you need, take it.

1644
02:01:29,625 --> 02:01:31,666
Forget about TRAI and all that nonsense?

1645
02:01:32,583 --> 02:01:33,666
What if I don’t agree?

1646
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,708
I won’t do anything to you.

1647
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:37,375
I wouldn’t even cross your path the next time.

1648
02:01:37,833 --> 02:01:38,875
Promise.

1649
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,208
You can leave.

1650
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:43,791
Please hand over the car keys to the lawyer.

1651
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:57,125
Please, leave dear.

1652
02:01:59,166 --> 02:02:00,250
No one is going to harm you.

1653
02:02:52,500 --> 02:02:53,375
Surya…

1654
02:02:53,625 --> 02:02:54,500
Surya…

1655
02:02:54,583 --> 02:02:55,458
Surya…!

1656
02:02:59,791 --> 02:03:00,666
Surya…!

1657
02:03:01,083 --> 02:03:02,416
How was that fear?

1658
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:06,666
Is this a great fear, right?

1659
02:03:09,833 --> 02:03:11,875
Yes, it was wrong.
but it happened.

1660
02:03:12,708 --> 02:03:15,416
We couldn't correct with just an apology.

1661
02:03:16,083 --> 02:03:17,166
I will compensate you for it.

1662
02:03:24,916 --> 02:03:25,916
Ten crores for you.

1663
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:28,625
Since you have no one...

1664
02:03:29,541 --> 02:03:30,666
we will become relatives.

1665
02:03:31,875 --> 02:03:34,958
I will get a good girl from my family
and get you married to her.

1666
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,250
Please try to understand my 40 years
of political life, brother.

1667
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:45,750
Why don’t you say something?

1668
02:03:47,208 --> 02:03:48,125
Isn’t that enough?

1669
02:03:48,583 --> 02:03:49,791
Do you want more?

1670
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:55,416
I want justice.
Will you give it to me?

1671
02:03:57,958 --> 02:03:59,416
A 40-year political career?

1672
02:04:01,041 --> 02:04:03,291
Is your life that worthy?
Not mine..!?

1673
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:06,666
Five years…

1674
02:04:07,416 --> 02:04:08,541
In four walls…

1675
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:12,666
I will show you what that
kind of pain looks like.

1676
02:04:15,458 --> 02:04:17,416
You asked me how dare you file
a case on powerful people?

1677
02:04:18,666 --> 02:04:20,291
Now, you came to know the power of Section 211?

1678
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:22,791
See you in the court tomorrow.

1679
02:04:50,625 --> 02:04:51,750
He is guilty.

1680
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:55,208
That is why I punished him.

1681
02:04:58,416 --> 02:05:02,708
You can go to the court, take back your case...

1682
02:05:02,875 --> 02:05:06,333
Come here and take him with you.

1683
02:05:08,333 --> 02:05:09,500
Think about it.

1684
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:12,541
Case?

1685
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,666

Madam, Surya’s phone has been
switched off since the morning.

1697
02:07:49,666 --> 02:07:51,000
And even yours too.

1698
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:51,791
What exactly happened?

1699
02:07:53,708 --> 02:07:54,250
Sister...

1700
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:55,625
I am asking you.

1701
02:07:55,666 --> 02:07:56,500
Where is Surya?

1702
02:07:57,291 --> 02:07:58,541
He is with Nagendra.

1703
02:07:59,541 --> 02:08:01,958
He is vacillating between life and death.

1704
02:08:07,125 --> 02:08:07,791
Madam…

1705
02:08:08,458 --> 02:08:09,958
Let’s take him to the hospital urgently, madam.

1706
02:08:10,375 --> 02:08:12,708
He lost everything in his life, madam.

1707
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:16,333
There was never a moment of joy
in his life for the past five years.

1708
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:17,583
All he had was sorrow.

1709
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,875
Madam, let’s not bother ourselves with the case.

1710
02:08:19,958 --> 02:08:21,333
I want my friend is alive.

1711
02:08:21,333 --> 02:08:21,916
Please, madam.

1712
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,416
Please, I beg you.

1713
02:08:23,666 --> 02:08:25,208
Madam, please. Please.

1714
02:08:25,375 --> 02:08:27,583
Don’t you understand when I tell you?
Are you human or an animal?

1715
02:08:29,541 --> 02:08:31,291
Sorry, madam. Sorry.

1716
02:08:31,583 --> 02:08:33,125
Let’s withdraw the case, ma’am.

1717
02:08:33,291 --> 02:08:34,625
Let’s take him to the hospital, ma’am.

1718
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:38,750
I beg you. I beg you.

1719
02:08:39,416 --> 02:08:41,083
Please, madam.

1720
02:08:41,833 --> 02:08:43,208
Please, madam.

1721
02:08:43,208 --> 02:08:45,041
Please, madam.
Let’s take him to the hospital.

1722
02:08:45,041 --> 02:08:45,708
Please, madam.

1723
02:08:47,708 --> 02:08:50,708
Did you leave him there without
taking him to the hospital?

1724
02:08:52,208 --> 02:08:53,500
Are you human?

1725
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,791
Are you human at all?

1726
02:09:00,166 --> 02:09:04,416
We worked hard to get him out of jail
and here you are risking his life!

1727
02:09:07,208 --> 02:09:09,458
Because of that police officer,
he lost five years.

1728
02:09:09,625 --> 02:09:11,750
But Surya’s 211 case is costing him his life.

1729
02:09:12,958 --> 02:09:13,958
Oh god!

1730
02:09:20,333 --> 02:09:21,625
Aadhya Mullapudi.

1731
02:09:22,166 --> 02:09:25,208
I am bloody... warning you!

1732
02:09:25,333 --> 02:09:27,083
Let us withdraw the case.

1733
02:09:27,291 --> 02:09:28,541
I mean it, bloody…

1734
02:09:29,125 --> 02:09:31,833
Why would we need her approval?
Let’s get our friend out of there.

1735
02:09:31,833 --> 02:09:32,791
Come.

1736
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:36,250
You are thinking about the life of
a single friend of yours.

1737
02:09:39,333 --> 02:09:40,041
But, Surya...

1738
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,875
wishes to light up the lives of many people.

1739
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,250
Are you scared, lawyer?

1740
02:09:48,666 --> 02:09:49,666
Don’t be scared.

1741
02:09:50,625 --> 02:09:55,125
It costed the lives of 10 lakh people
for our country to gain it's independence.

1742
02:09:56,041 --> 02:09:59,791
It costed the lives of 13 hundred people
for a new state to be born.

1743
02:10:01,041 --> 02:10:04,875
There's never been any occasion in the entire history
where justice was served without the loss of life.

1744
02:10:06,041 --> 02:10:07,541
You keep saying it…

1745
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:09,666
…when you argue, justice wins…

1746
02:10:09,708 --> 02:10:11,458
…when we go to war, the good wins.

1747
02:10:11,958 --> 02:10:13,000
Go and argue, lawyer.

1748
02:10:13,791 --> 02:10:16,500
Fight the war and win the 211 case.

1749
02:10:17,083 --> 02:10:18,375
Win it!

1750
02:10:25,416 --> 02:10:26,958
Shall we take a step back because we are scared?

1751
02:10:27,666 --> 02:10:29,125
Or shall we risk it and keep going forward?

1752
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:37,500
If we go forward, we will create history.

1753
02:10:38,416 --> 02:10:41,250
If we take a step back, we will be part of history.

1754
02:10:45,916 --> 02:10:46,750
Tell me.

1755
02:10:47,583 --> 02:10:48,541

'After 15 Days'

1789
02:14:30,958 --> 02:14:32,000
Hello, Kishore.

1790
02:14:32,208 --> 02:14:34,625
Are you still worrying yourself
over Surya’s case?

1791
02:14:34,625 --> 02:14:38,375
Nothing of that sort, sir.
After his release, he’s been minding his own business.

1792
02:14:38,541 --> 02:14:39,708
I don’t think he would seek revenge.

1793
02:14:40,666 --> 02:14:41,750
Why would he try?

1794
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:44,125
If he did, I am sure you will
frame him in another case.

1795
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,541
Sir…

1796
02:14:47,666 --> 02:14:48,958
What’s this 211 case?

1797
02:14:49,208 --> 02:14:50,250
I will take care of it, sir.

1798
02:14:50,458 --> 02:14:52,208
This isn’t a case that pertains to your police station.

1799
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:55,083
If something goes wrong,
we may end up behind bars.

1800
02:14:55,458 --> 02:14:57,208
I am sending my lawyer, Satya Murthy.

1801
02:14:57,375 --> 02:14:58,458
He will guide you on what needs to be done.

1802
02:14:59,875 --> 02:15:02,333
Chandraiah is under the protection of Surya.

1803
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:05,708
If he comes to the court tomorrow,
the case will turn in their favor.

1804
02:15:05,833 --> 02:15:09,208
If he comes to the court, he must cross me.

1805
02:15:35,708 --> 02:15:39,416
In the case filed by Bandi Surya Prakash
under Section 211...

1806
02:15:39,833 --> 02:15:46,041
It has been proven that ACP Kishore has conspired and
framed Surya Prakash in Raja Gopal’s murder.

1807
02:15:47,916 --> 02:15:54,625
The court came to a conclusion that the
primary conspirator was ex-Home Minister, Nagendra.

1808
02:15:54,791 --> 02:16:02,291
Denying them the opportunity of public’s forgiveness,
the court sentences them to life imprisonment.

1809
02:16:08,708 --> 02:16:13,958
Surya Prakash and all the future citizens
who win the case through section 211 case...

1810
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:19,750
The court instructs the justice system to consider them
not as an accused, but as a Victim.

1811
02:16:21,458 --> 02:16:22,916
Every victory has struggle behind it.

1812
02:16:23,333 --> 02:16:25,083
Every struggle will lead you a step ahead.

1813
02:16:25,666 --> 02:16:28,000
That is the foundation of our victory.
